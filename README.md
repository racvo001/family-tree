Share screen so we can follow along.
Clone the project's code, import it into your IDE of choice.

### TASK

When you run the app, it should ask for a person's full name and then print to the console that person's family tree, aka person's descendants (person's children, grandchildren, great-grandchildren, etc.). 
The order in which the descendants should be printed is irrelevant.

You are allowed to change any code you see fit other than the "database" itself - families.json.

### ASSUMPTIONS

There might be some bugs in the code. You are free to fix them as you see fit.
You can assume the "people" in the families.json file have unique names.
